# SendIdeasHome — The Global Idea Harbor

**Where ideas return with their names intact.**

---

## What This Is (Plain Language)

SendIdeasHome is not a marketplace.  
It is not a patent office.  
It is not a gate.

It is a **Harbor for Ideas**.

A place where ideas can:
• Arrive safely  
• Depart freely  
• Be recorded with dignity  
• Keep their origin  
• Leave a trace instead of disappearing  

This Harbor exists especially for underserved communities and developing nations, honoring **Afroingenuity** and global innovation without extraction.

---

## Why This Exists

In many systems, ideas are taken, relabeled, sold, and the giver is erased.

This Harbor exists to change that.

Instead of patents, we use **timestamping**.  
Instead of gatekeepers, we use **memory**.  
Instead of extraction, we use **gifting**.

Every idea remains tied to its giver.

## How This Harbor Works

1. A person submits an idea  
2. The idea is recorded  
3. The moment is timestamped  
4. The origin is preserved  
5. The idea is free to travel  
6. The giver is never erased  

This is not ownership.  
This is remembrance.

## How to Submit an Idea

Use this template:

📄 [`docs/idea_submission_template.md`](docs/idea_submission_template.md)

Short ideas are welcome.  
Simple ideas are welcome.  
Early ideas are welcome.

---

## How Proof Works

Every idea can receive a **Proof Record**.

This is not a patent.  
It is a memory anchor.

It records:
• Who gave it  
• When it was given  
• What it was  
• Where it is stored  
• How it may be used

## The Canonical Record

The founding mission, structure, and DNA of this Harbor lives here:

📜 [`docs/sendideashome_origin_record.md`](docs/sendideashome_origin_record.md)

This is the Harbor’s logbook.

## This Is Part of IFAM

SendIdeasHome is part of the IFAM ecosystem  
(**Ideas For All Mankind**)

It connects with:
• Repomorphing  
• MicroscopicGold  
• Random Rain  
• Wallet Managers  
• BlockyRight  
• Web3tionary  

But this Harbor remains neutral ground.

---

## What Happens Next

This Harbor will host:
• Idea Drops  
• Public submissions  
• Educational pilots  
• Global participation  
• Memory trails  
• Proof archives  

No gatekeeping.  
No extraction.  
No erasure.

## Final Word

A harbor does not own ships.  
It serves them.

If you arrive here with an idea,  
you will not be erased.

You will be recorded.

Welcome home.
