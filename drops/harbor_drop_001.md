## What This Drop Is

This is the first recorded “ship” to enter the Harbor.

It demonstrates how an idea can:
• Arrive safely  
• Be recorded with dignity  
• Keep its origin  
• Be time-anchored  
• Travel freely  

This Drop is not a product.  
It is a **proof of concept for a new way of remembering.**

## The Idea (Pilot Entry)

**Title:** The Idea Harbor Drop (Pilot Entry)  
**Originator / Giver:** Lloyd W. Jones Jr. (LWJr)  
**Location:** United States (diaspora)  
**Intent:** Outbound toward developing nations (e.g., Burkina Faso)

**Description:**  
A Harbor system where people can submit practical ideas without expensive patent systems. Each idea is recorded, time-anchored, and preserved with the giver’s name attached—so ideas can travel without being erased.

**Permission:** Gifted for use with attribution.

## Proof of Origin (Time Anchor)

This idea has been cryptographically time-anchored.

**Hash Type:** SHA-256  
**Hash Value:**  
`3104dddd0dfd80670c21e8ebd7f77d0430c7fefe51557f76ae7af83854b85120`

If even one letter of the original changes, this hash changes.  
This proves this exact version existed at this exact time.

## Why This Matters (Plain Language)

In many systems:
Ideas are taken.  
Names are removed.  
Credit disappears.

In this Harbor:
Ideas are sent, not taken.  
Names are kept, not erased.  
Memory replaces extraction.

## The Parable Version

A man comes to a harbor carrying a small box.

Inside is not gold.  
Inside is not money.  
Inside is an idea.

In the old world, ships would take the box, repaint it, sell it, and forget the man.

In this Harbor, the keeper writes in the log:

“This box came from him. On this day. From this place.”

Then the man is free to send it anywhere.

The Harbor does not own the box.

It remembers him.
