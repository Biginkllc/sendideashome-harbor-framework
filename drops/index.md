# 🌊 SendIdeasHome — Harbor Drop Index

This index lists all public Harbor Drops.

A Harbor Drop is a recorded idea entry that:
• Preserves origin  
• Is time-anchored  
• Remains free to travel  
• Cannot be erased  

This is not ownership.  
This is remembrance.

## What This Index Is

This index is a public log of arrivals.

Like ships entering a harbor, each idea is recorded:
• With a name  
• With a date  
• With a trail  

No idea is anonymous unless the giver chooses it.
