# How to Submit an Idea to SendIdeasHome

You do not need money.  
You do not need credentials.  
You do not need permission.

If you have an idea, you belong here.

## What Counts as an Idea?

An idea can be:
• A tool  
• A method  
• A teaching trick  
• A design  
• A system  
• A story  
• A solution to a problem  
• A better way of doing something  

It does not need to be perfect.  
It does not need to be finished.

---

## Step 1 — Write Your Idea

Use this simple form:

📄 `docs/idea_submission_template.md`

You can write in plain language.

Short is fine.  
Simple is fine.  
Incomplete is fine.

---

## Step 2 — Add Your Name (or Chosen Name)

You may use:
• Your real name  
• A public name  
• A pseudonym  

This Harbor exists to keep your name from being erased.

---

## Step 3 — Choose How Others May Use It

You can say:
• “Use it freely, just credit me.”  
• “Education only.”  
• “Ask me first.”  

You decide.

---

## Step 4 — Submit It

Right now, submissions happen by:

• Creating a file using the template  
• Naming it with today’s date  
• Placing it in the `/submissions/` folder  

Later, we will add simpler methods.

## What Happens After You Submit

Your idea will:

1. Be recorded  
2. Be dated  
3. Keep your name  
4. Be given a proof record  
5. Be allowed to travel  

This is not a sale.

This is a gift.

---

## What Is a Proof Record?

A proof record is a page that says:

“This idea existed.  
On this day.  
From this person.”

It protects you without trapping your idea.

---

## You Are Not Giving Up Your Idea

You are not losing your idea.

You are giving it a **trail**.

---

## Why This Matters

Too many ideas vanish.

Not because they weren’t good —  
but because their givers were invisible.

This Harbor exists so that does not happen.

---

## The Core Rule

Ideas may travel.  
Names may not disappear.

---

If you are unsure about anything, that is okay.

Harbors are built for arrivals.
