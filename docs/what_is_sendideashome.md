# What Is SendIdeasHome?

**SendIdeasHome is a Harbor for Ideas.**

Not a marketplace.  
Not a patent office.  
Not a gate.

A Harbor.

A place where ideas can arrive safely, be recorded with dignity, and travel freely—without the giver being erased.

## Why This Exists

Across the world, especially in underserved and developing communities, people carry powerful ideas.

But too often, when those ideas travel:
• The name is lost  
• The origin is erased  
• The credit disappears  
• Others profit  

SendIdeasHome exists so that doesn’t happen.

This Harbor preserves:
• Origin  
• Memory  
• Attribution  
• Dignity

## What Happens Here

When an idea enters this Harbor:

1. It is written down in simple language  
2. The giver’s name is recorded  
3. The date is preserved  
4. A proof record is created  
5. The idea is free to travel  

This is not ownership.

This is remembrance.

## Why We Call It a Harbor

A harbor does not own ships.

It:
• Receives them  
• Records them  
• Protects them  
• Sends them onward  
• Remembers where they came from  

That is what this place does for ideas.

## Who This Is For

This Harbor is for:
• Students  
• Builders  
• Tinkerers  
• Teachers  
• Elders  
• Innovators  
• Problem-solvers  
• Anyone with an idea  

You do not need credentials.  
You do not need money.  
You do not need permission.

## What This Is Not

This is not:
❌ A marketplace  
❌ A patent system  
❌ A corporate platform  
❌ A gatekeeping structure  

It is a public memory system.

## What Is a Harbor Drop?

A Harbor Drop is a public record that says:

> “This idea arrived here, from this person, on this day.”

Like a ship arriving in a harbor, it is logged and remembered.

---

## What Is Proof?

Proof here does not mean ownership.

It means:
• This existed  
• In this form  
• At this time  
• From this person  

This protects origin without trapping the idea.

---

## The Core Promise

Ideas may travel.  
Names may not disappear.

---

## What You Can Do

You can:
• Submit an idea  
• Let it be recorded  
• Keep your name attached  
• Allow it to travel  
• Never be erased

Welcome to the Harbor.

Your ideas belong to the world.  
Your name belongs to you.
