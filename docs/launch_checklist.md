# SendIdeasHome — Launch Checklist

This is not a marketing launch.

This is a **harbor opening**.

---

## What You Already Have

You now have:

- A public Harbor (repo)
- A Canonical Origin Record
- A Submission System
- A Proof System
- A Time-Anchored Pilot
- A Published Harbor Drop
- A Public Index
- Plain-language guides
- Visual explainers

This is real infrastructure.

---

## Step 1 — Choose One Place to Share First

Do not post everywhere at once.

Choose ONE:
- LinkedIn
- Email list
- University contact
- WhatsApp group
- Community forum
- Website
- GitHub discussion

---

## Step 2 — Use the Simple Share Text

Use one of the versions from Stage 4:

Short version is best for first contact.

Do not explain everything.

Let curiosity do the work.

---

## Step 3 — Link Only One Page

Do NOT overwhelm people.

Link to:
📄 `docs/what_is_sendideashome.md`

That is the front door.

---

## Step 4 — Invite, Don’t Pitch

Say:

“This is open.”
“This is public.”
“This is for you.”

Not:
“This is my project.”

This is a harbor.

---

## Step 5 — Expect Confusion (That’s Normal)

People will ask:
- Is this a business?
- Is this a patent system?
- Is this blockchain?
- Is this a nonprofit?

Answer simply:
“It’s a memory harbor for ideas.”

---

## Step 6 — First 10 Submissions Matter More Than 1,000 Views

Your first 10 real submissions will define this.

Not likes.
Not comments.
Not traffic.

Submissions.

---

## Step 7 — Always Point to the Templates

Never explain everything by hand.

Always link:

- Submission: `docs/idea_submission_template.md`
- Proof: `docs/proof_record_template.md`

---

## Step 8 — Keep It Human

This Harbor wins by being:
• Gentle
• Clear
• Open
• Non-judgmental
• Non-extractive

Not by being clever.

---

## Step 9 — Document, Don’t Optimize

Early on:
Do not optimize.
Document.

Record what happens.

---

## Step 10 — You Are Not the Gate

You are the keeper of the logbook.

Not the owner of the ships.

---

## Reminder

This is not a startup.

This is a public memory system.

Act accordingly.
