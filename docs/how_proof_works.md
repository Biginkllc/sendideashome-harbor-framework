# How Proof Works at SendIdeasHome (Plain Language)

Proof here does not mean ownership.

It means:
• This idea existed  
• In this form  
• At this time  
• From this person  

That’s it.

## Why Proof Matters

When ideas travel, names often disappear.

Proof exists so that does not happen.

It keeps:
• The giver visible  
• The origin intact  
• The memory permanent  

---

## What Is a Timestamp?

A timestamp is simply a recorded date.

It says:
> “This idea was here on this day.”

This matters because it shows when something first appeared.

---

## What Is a Hash?

A hash is like a fingerprint for a document.

If you change even one letter, the fingerprint changes.

That means:
• The content is frozen in time  
• The record cannot be faked  
• The version is permanent

## Why This Is Better Than a Patent (For Most People)

Patents are expensive.  
Patents are slow.  
Patents are exclusive.  

This system is:
• Free  
• Fast  
• Open  
• Memory-based  

You are not locking your idea.

You are anchoring it.

---

## What Proof Protects

Proof protects:
• Your name  
• Your contribution  
• Your moment in time  

It does not trap your idea.

It lets it travel.

---

## What Proof Does Not Do

Proof does NOT:
❌ Stop others from improving your idea  
❌ Turn your idea into property  
❌ Create legal walls  

This is not about control.

This is about remembrance.

## Why This Matters Globally

Many of the world’s best ideas come from places where:
• Patents are inaccessible  
• Lawyers are unaffordable  
• Credit is stolen  

This Harbor exists so that doesn’t happen.

---

## Simple Summary

Proof is memory.

Memory protects dignity.

Dignity lets ideas travel without being erased.

---

## The Rule

Ideas may travel.  
Names may not disappear.
