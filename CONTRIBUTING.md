# Contributing to This Repository  
*A Harbor for Ideas — Contribution Without Extraction*

Thank you for being here.

This repository is part of an **Ideas For All Mankind (IFAM)** ecosystem.  
It exists to **share**, **preserve**, and **repomorph** ideas in a way that honors
origin, authorship, and learning — not ownership or extraction.

You do not need to be a developer to contribute.
You do not need permission to think.

## What It Means to Contribute Here

Contribution can be as simple as:
- noticing a pattern
- suggesting a new use
- improving clarity
- adding an example
- asking a thoughtful question

You are not expected to:
- write code

Your contribution is valued for its **idea**, not its technical polish.
